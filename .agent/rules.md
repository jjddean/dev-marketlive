# Project Rules

- **No Unauthorized Edits**: Never edit the application code or configuration files without explicit confirmation from the user.
- **Wait for Instructions**: Always ask for instructions or verification before taking action on the codebase.
- **Single App focus**: Focus development on the main MarketLive application (port 8080).
